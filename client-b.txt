START
Define the layout of the warehouse as a grid
Set 'target_position' as a variable
Set 'user_position' as a variable
Get user_position
Get target_position
Check if user_position is equal to target_position
WHILE user_position does not equal target_position
	if target position (x, y) is greater than user position (on x), prompt user to move south
 	if target position (x, y) is less than user position (on x), prompt user to move north
 	if target position (x, y) is greater than user position (on y), prompt user to move east
 	if target position (x, y) is less than user position (on y), prompt user to move west
repeat until user_position is equal to target_position
